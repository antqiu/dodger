The objective of the game is to dodge the incoming targets for as long as possible. Touching the borders of the screen will also end the game.

Press WASD to move. You can also click your left mouse button to shoot a yellow bullet that will respawn the targets. 
</span><span  class="e2_71">The targets respawn with a random width at the top of the screen every time it reaches max height.
 
Getting hit by a target will respawn both your ship and the targets and display the time you survived for in a monitor. There is also a high score monitor.</span><div  class="e2_37"></div><span  class="e2_47">CONTROLS</span><span  class="e5_15">BUGS:</span><div  class="e2_39"></div><span  class="e2_49">This Processing Sketch uses BRC, which creates controls inside a webpage. It can be accessed by pasting in the IP Address that’s printed in the console when the sketch is run into a browser. For best use, minimize the browser so that fits under the Sketch.
